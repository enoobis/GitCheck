"GitCheck" is a simple Python program with a GUI that allows you to check the availability of usernames on GitHub. With a dark theme inspired by GitHub's design, the program makes it easy to input a desired username and quickly see if it's available on the platform. The project's name, "GitCheck," reflects its focus on checking GitHub usernames and includes a nod to Git version control.
